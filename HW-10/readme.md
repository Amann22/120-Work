# Week Ten Response

## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying attention to the individual choices you made.
During this homework cycle I decided to use some preexisting code that I had made for an earlier week. I added an array as well as reorganizing the code into new functions that I renamed and used. Reusing some code helped me out, It allowed me to spend more time experimenting with new topics.

## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
I followed the site very closely and watched the videos posted on the page. This weeks material wasn't to hard to follow.

## 3. Did you have any issues? how did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
I did have some issues with organization but I am trying to keep it clean. Using these new functions that we can name instead of having everything in draw is very helpful to separate and label the code.

## 4. Is there anything in particular that you learned that you would like to discuss more?
I like learning about the array but I am still not fully sure of all its uses.

## 5. What issues did you help your classmates out with this week?
I worked with another student outside of class this week, and kept an eye on the forum looking for things I could help with.

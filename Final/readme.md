# Final Project

## 1. Outcome
The outcome of final project went well. In my opinion I learned much more throughout the final project than I did throughout the semester. This work really made me focus and create something that was more interactive and interesting than my previous projects. Throughout the last two weeks I was constantly making small changes and messing with my code, I had many problems to face but focusing on them one by one allowed me to overcome.
## 2. Problems
I had countless problems with my code, and these helped to teach me important lessons as well as guided me. Sometimes I felt like I never knew the root my problems. This was my restraint. I just tried to use as many resources as I could and learn more about the code. This was also my first project using multiple .js files, this had some initial problems but proved to be very worth while. I also has some problems with new code changing and effecting the previous lines but with trial and error I overcame this issue.
## 3. Success/Failure
I think that the product that I created is very interesting, the game has many different features and is visually interesting as well. Some of the main problems that I worked with were in relation to the different .js files and using multiple in this project, this helped me to organize my code and create something more complex. For success's I think that the Idea for the game is interesting to players. This project is by the far the most complex that is have created.
## 4 Creative Coding overall
This class was very informing, starting with no coding experience at all I have come along way throughout this course. I feel comfortable with using Atom but I still feel that I have alot more work till I will be-able to use this program fluidly. The project in this class were very fun and allowed the user to create what interested them! Being an artist, I love it!

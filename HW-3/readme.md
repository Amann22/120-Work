# Week Three Response

## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying attention to the individual choices you made.

This week I started the process earlier and just followed very closely. watching the videos and also reading the steps as i went along. This worked well and also this week there were less new programs and just building upon what we have learned which made it much easier for myself.

## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

This week I started much earlier with my assignment this gave me more freedom to text out each new thing and really get a grip for what we had to learn. Along with this I just followed the site very closely.

## 3. Did you have any issues? how did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

I had many smaller problems this week some I addresses myself and with a couple I was helped by the generous folks in the media arts building. One problem I had was trying to add the location of my 120-work to the url i had to add some steps but eventually figured it out.

## 4. Is there anything in particular that you learned that you would like to discuss more?

I was wondering if one can add multiple canvases onto one page or if there is another way to split up the page. I had alot of problems with push and pop

## 5. What issues did you help your classmates out with this week?

I browsed the online forum looking to post on others problems.

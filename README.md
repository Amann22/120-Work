# Week Four Response

## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying attention to the individual choices you made.

This week I simply spent more time working with atom, this weeks homework assignment allowed you to be creative and spend your time experimenting with the program. I learned alot while working on my portrait.

## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

This week I just spend alot of time changing things and trying different options, I still have a way to go but I am definitely improving. The instruction for this weeks homework were pretty simple so I just spent all my time working on that.
## 3. Did you have any issues? how did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

I did have some issues finding a good order to put my code in. One problem that I had was with the push() and the pop() for some reason I could not get these to work in my system. One other problem that I had was with the corner rounder on the rect command. I was filling in the cordinates and info but the shapes would not react as planned.

## 4. Is there anything in particular that you learned that you would like to discuss more?

I learned about the draw function but I would like to continue to use it and see what I can come up with.

## 5. What issues did you help your classmates out with this week?

I browsed the online forum looking to post on others problems.

# Final Proposal

## 1. Proposal-
For my final project I want to create a game using Java. My aim is create a evasion based game using the mouse or arrow-keys, having to dodge objects and collect others. I think that this will be a challenge that will encourage me to learn some new code.

## 2. Influence
My influence is old arcade games. Games that I grew up with like frogger and pac-man. My version will most likely be much more simple but based of this type of game. Hopefully I will be able to add different levels and create a interesting project.

## 3. Problems
There will be many problems I have to face while taking on this challenge. I haven't worked much interacting objects causing outcomes but this interests me. I would like to try to create different levels to this game but based on research seems difficult.

## 4. Work Plan
I am leaving Montana early tomorrow (friday), and returning sunday night. This means that other than my work this last week and today I will have to work throughout next week. My plan is to complete the idea and layout the structure by the 2nd and after this I will lay down some base code and trouble shoot. I would like to have a working game completed by the 5th so that I can mess with the code and try to make some upgrades/changes by the due date.

## 5. Work Done
So far I have just been doing research and trying to find similar code to what I am working with. From this I can take some ideas and create my own project. I have been watching many instructional videos working with java and this helps my understanding of the layout.

# Week THREE Response

## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying attention to the individual choices you made.

This week I started the process earlier and just followed very closely. watching the videos and also reading the steps as i went along. This worked well and also this week there were less new programs and just building upon what we have learned which made it much easier for myself.

## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

While working on the assignment I used not only the available resources but also did some research to help me understand more about these softwares. I tried to mirror the videos with my computer and programs to help.

## 3. Did you have any issues? how did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

Yes I did have many problems come up but with time and tinkering/ research I was able to complete the homework. I did not come to post about my issues because I considered them small problems that I could solve myself. Therefore I did not receive any feedback from other students but reading through the forum helped me while I was working.

## 4. Is there anything in particular that you learned that you would like to discuss more?

I would like to talk more about commands, I do not know many but especially for moving files and more intricate commands. I was never aware that one can control their computer like that.

## 5. What issues did you help your classmates out with this week?

I browsed the forums and conversations looking for smaller problems that I could help with, unfortunately I felt a little behind myself.

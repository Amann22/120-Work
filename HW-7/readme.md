# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing
The code in this project is moving a ball across the screen and allowing it to change speed and course based on timing and mouse clicks. Some of this code is based on true/false (boolean) and others are more specific.

The lines 1-10 are setting up the size of ball and parameters for movement.
After this the code moves on to set the background and the canvas of which everything is on. The draw function that starts on line 19 is the parameters for the movement of the ball using some math based functions. 32 and 33 code for the color of the moving ball. The lines 36-40 are the functions used to alter the speed and path of the ball once the mouse has been clicked.

## How did you alter the sketch?

To alter this sketch I wanted to try as many posibilities as possible so I just experimented and changed all the code around. One of this things that I liked the most was the mouse commands. In my sketch I used the mouseispressed function to grow the traveling circle, what I would want to do next is with the same but add code that makes the circle slowly shrink to its original size if the mouse was not pressed. This would allow you to make some really fun projects.

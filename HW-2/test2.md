# Week Two Response

## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying attention to the individual choices you made.

This week was particularly difficult for me, downloading and trying to learn multiple programs took lots of time but I feel that I and starting to better understand what it takes. During this cycle I went through the posted course materials very carefully and tried to spend some time messing with each program. This made me feel more comfortable with these many new concepts.

## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

While working on the assignment I used not only the available resources but also did some research to help me understand more about these softwares. I tried to mirror the videos with my computer and programs to help.

## 3. Did you have any issues? how did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates.?

# Week six Response

## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying attention to the individual choices you made.

This week was slightly more difficult, the material is becoming more detailed but the uses are greatly increasing. For this homework cycle I did alot more outside research and exploration, I tried to keep my code as simple as possible while still creating what I first imagined.

## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

This week was interesting because much of the code that we learned progresses over time. This means that quick trial and error is more difficult and it took more time to created what you wanted. Again I went through the pages on the website and tested the new material as I went, this allowed me to have a handle on each thing before learning the next.

## 3. Did you have any issues? how did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

For the past couple weeks I have been having issues with my readme and the placement of this file, this week I spent some time in the lab asking questions and figuring out the past problems. Emily Griffon really helped me out with these problems.

## 4. Is there anything in particular that you learned that you would like to discuss more?

This week I kept trying to put in multiple elements that sometimes counteracted each other. One example of this would be trying to have the background change color while also having the ellipse creations over time stay. I was wondering in things like this are possible.

## 5. What issues did you help your classmates out with this week?

This week I was unable to assist classmates, there were not many posts on the forum and nothing that I was able to answer.

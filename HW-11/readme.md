# Week Eleven Response

## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying attention to the individual choices you made.
This week proved to be very difficult. This new concept is very interesting but understanding the basis of OOP's and why they are useful is very difficult. I was very happy with the sketch that I created, it could have been done with the coding knowledge from last week but this new application is interesting.


## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
I closely followed the website and forum, this week took me the most time. I did much of my coding on a separate computer and had to transfer some work, this wasn't very difficult. I also watched most of the more popular OOP videos out there.

## 3. Did you have any issues? how did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
This week was definetly the most difficult for me yet. I had alot of trouble understanding the OOP's but after watching many videos I seem to understand this new way of coding.

## 4. Is there anything in particular that you learned that you would like to discuss more?
I would like to learn more about OOP's in general I feel that I don't have the best grasp on this yet and from the different videos this seems important in coding these days.

## 5. What issues did you help your classmates out with this week?
I worked on this weeks objectives somewhat late, much of my classmates had their questions answered.

# Week eight Response

## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying attention to the individual choices you made.
  This week was a huge relief for me, I have been a little behind but it game me the opportunity to catch up and still learn a very cool loop function. I went through the website and read through each page making sure to mess with the code and experiment. I also went back to last week and revisited some of the lesson from last week.

## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
  For this project I started with a basic looping code using ellipses and I put a couple different looping cycles going at one creating a very interesting page. Once done with this I messed with the size and orientation of the different loops. Last off I added color.

## 3. Did you have any issues? how did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
  I didn't have many issues with this weeks project. But I really like the application of what we learned this week.

## 4. Is there anything in particular that you learned that you would like to discuss more?
  I would like to discuss the movement of the loops, It was mentioned a little bit but I think being able to let the loop functions move around randomly would look awesome.
## 5. What issues did you help your classmates out with this week?
This I tried to do some research and look into some of the emails that other students had sent and had problems but i was unable to help anyone.

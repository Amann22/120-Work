# Week Five Response

## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying attention to the individual choices you made.

This week went well but it took me much longer to complete then I would have expected. Without the same videos as the previous weeks I just studied the different pages on the website while doing tests on atom. I started later but I still just buckled down and put in the time that I needed to learn it.

## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

This week consisted of mostly trial and error tests, as I went through the posted material I tested much of the code on my own. Because we are getting into more interesting creations it was very cool to play with code and experiment.

## 3. Did you have any issues? how did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

As always I had some issues but with trial and error and help from another classmate I was able to create, what I think is very cool. One problem that I am still having relates to the sandboxes and how they work, I am currently working on this but I was having trouble with it.

## 4. Is there anything in particular that you learned that you would like to discuss more?

This week I learned alot more about the organization of code and how this can it it much easier for a coder. I need to get in the good habits now when our code is generally simple.

## 5. What issues did you help your classmates out with this week?

This week I was able to ask a classmate questions and talk about the software, this was very helpful for me and hopefully them.
